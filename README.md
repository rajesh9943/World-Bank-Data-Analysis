# Expose The Global Development Trends through World Bank Data Analysis
In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled The best stats you've ever seen.(Must watch this video before working on the project). At the beginning of the talk, he showed an animation he made to debunk some misconceptions about today's world.

I enjoyed seeing this visualisation and I want you to reproduce it with the tools you know (i.e. Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib). 
Dataset Information<br>

●	Life expectancy at birth: The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same<br> &nbsp;  throughout his life.<br>
●	Fertility rate: Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years. <br>
●	Country population: Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates)<br>

**Hans Rosling built this animation, after testing his students on global health, he realised that they still thought that the world was divided in two:**<br>

●	The Western world: low fertility rate and high life expectancy<br>
●	The third world: high fertility rate and low life expectancy<br>
●	More data:  The talk was made in 2006 with data from 1962 to 2003. We will use data from 1960 to 2016.<br>
●	Regions: The original visualisation has five regions. We will keep the regions from the source data (i.e. seven regions).<br>
●	Colours. We can't get the exact colours of the regions. Feel free to use your colour mapping.<br>

**In this task, build the same animated graph as you watched in the video, For the visualization perform the following steps:**

1.	Load Data
2.	Data Overview
3.	Handle Missing Values
4.	Data Types
5.	Merge DataFrames (If required for any visualization)

1.	Population Trends (Years vs Population)(Line Graph)
2.	Fertility rate distribution 
3.	Life expectancy variation
4.	Correlation Analysis
5.	Regional Analysis
